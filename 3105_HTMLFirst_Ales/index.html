      <p>I am a dedicated <strong>Computer Science Engineering</strong> (BA, Engineering) and <strong>Astronomy</strong> (BA, Arts and Sciences) double major at the University of Colorado, Boulder, graduating in May 2023.</p>
      
      <p>I like to code, and have a passion for anything related to space!.</p>

      <p>My favorite current project involves designing and implementing a machine learning algorithm that can identify and categorize surface geological features on Saturn's natural satellite, Titan: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titan_(moon)">Saturn's Moon Titan</a>.</p>
